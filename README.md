# AdwumaPa
Empowering African Tech Talent Through Blockchain Innovation

AdwumaPa is a cutting-edge, blockchain-powered platform designed to revolutionize the way African tech professionals connect with global opportunities. By leveraging the power of distributed ledger technology, we've created a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace that puts talent first.


## The Problem

African youth are grossly marginalized in the tech hiring process. Even when talents are skilled and educated, they still struggle to get jobs. When they do get these jobs, they are often marginalised or discriminated against by their location and grossly underpaid 

Job discrimination is a real thing - just think of a young man, who switches his location from Nigeria to the UK and  all of a sudden begins to receive job offers, we want to change that narrative by building a product that really stands for what we believe in The Challenges 

Inability to find & secure global job opportunities

Discrimination based on location and race 

Inability to determine fair payment rates 

Difficulty in choosing payment channel and currency 



## The Solution 

AdwumaPa is a web3 startup that allows anyone to find top Africa talents, hire anonymously and then pay securely in crypto.We allow tech talents to overcome the hiring bias faced on international hiring platforms which tends to limit job roles to a certain location. Additionally, the negotiation power usually rests on the client who may or may not decide to pay for the work done. We give  talents full ownership of every project by locking the agreed amount until the project is completed.
